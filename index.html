            <h1> Welcome To <em>Angels</em> CSC 106 Website</h1> <br>
        <p>  
            My Name is <em>Angel Bencosme</em>, and this is my portfolio website that I made in HTML.<br>
            This website will contain the projects that I completed for CSC 106 the Joy of Programming at the
            University of Rhode Island.<br> This website was my first project ever as a programmer and it's going to be interesting to see my progress
            as I become a better programmer.<br> I hope that everything works as intended and that you enjoy!
